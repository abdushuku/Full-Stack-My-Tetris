By embracing our universal desire to create order out of chaos, the Tetris game provides intellectual sport that combines continuous fun with mental stimulation.

## Task

- Implement additional features such as:
- Hold piece functionality
- Sound effects for actions like piece movement and line clear
- High score tracking and leaderboard
- Refactor code for better readability and maintainability.
- Add more styling to improve the visual appeal of the game.

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to control falling Tetromino pieces, clear lines, and earn points as they progress through levels.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `https://github.com/abdushuku/Full-Stack-My-Tetris`.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.

## Usage

1. Upon opening the game, you will see the Tetris game board and the next piece preview on the right side.
2. Use the arrow keys (left, right, down) to move the falling Tetromino piece.
3. Press the up arrow key to rotate the piece clockwise.
4. Press the space bar to hard drop the piece directly to the bottom.
5. Aim to complete full lines horizontally to clear them and earn points.
6. As you clear lines and earn points, the game level will increase, making the pieces fall faster.
7. The game ends when the Tetromino stack reaches the top of the board.
